# CoverMax üõ°Ô∏è

_A decentralized insurance protocol powered by tradeable risk tokens_

## üéÆ Quick Start for Testing

Want to try out CoverMax? Use this test wallet that already has test tokens:

**Test Private Key:**

```
994fc012e651448eacdba62f2e49c17796e44aac67155e512894c23ddbf3e1fd
```

This wallet is pre-funded with test tokens (aUSDC, cUSDT) that you can use to:

- Deposit into insurance pools
- Receive and trade risk tokens
- Submit test claims
- Experience the full protocol lifecycle

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: This is a test private key for development purposes only. Never use it on mainnet or with real funds.

## Overview

CoverMax is a revolutionary insurance protocol that transforms traditional insurance through **tradeable risk tokens** for **yield-bearing collateral**. Users deposit yield-bearing assets (like aUSDC or cUSDT) and receive dual-tier risk tokens that can be traded on Uniswap. The more risk tokens sold in the market, the more insurance coverage is provided to the community.

## üß† How It Works

### The Insurance Mechanism

1. **Continuous Deposits**: Users can deposit yield-bearing assets (aUSDC, cUSDT) at any time during the protocol lifecycle
2. **Token Issuance**: For each deposit, users receive equal amounts of:
   - **Senior Risk Tokens** (CM-SENIOR) - Lower risk, priority claims
   - **Junior Risk Tokens** (CM-JUNIOR) - Higher risk, subordinate claims
3. **Trading**: Risk tokens can be traded on Uniswap like any ERC20 token throughout all phases
4. **Active Phase** (5 days): Combined deposit and coverage period where claims can be submitted
5. **Flexible Redemption**: Token holders can redeem tokens at any time with phase-specific rules

### The Risk-Insurance Relationship

The core innovation is that **selling risk tokens = providing insurance coverage**:

- When you **hold** risk tokens: You bear the risk of insurance claims
- When you **sell** risk tokens: You transfer that risk to the buyer
- When you **buy** risk tokens: You're taking on insurance risk for potential yield

### Example Scenarios

#### Risk Tier Trading (Advanced Strategy)

```
1. Alice deposits 1000 aUSDC ‚Üí receives 500 CM-SENIOR + 500 CM-JUNIOR tokens
2. Bob deposits 1000 cUSDT ‚Üí receives 500 CM-SENIOR + 500 CM-JUNIOR tokens
3. Bob wants more downside protection, so he trades on CM-SENIOR/CM-JUNIOR pool:
   - Sells 200 CM-JUNIOR tokens ‚Üí receives 190 CM-SENIOR tokens (5% lost in value)
4. Bob now holds 690 CM-SENIOR + 300 CM-JUNIOR tokens (990 total)
   - Result: Bob forfeited 10 tokens of potential upside for senior claim priority
5. Alice see a opportunity to buy cheap CM-JUNIOR tokens that are redeemable to the same underlying token, so she buys the them. She now holds 310 CM-SENIOR + 700 CM-JUNIOR tokens (1010 total)
6. If one of the underlying yield protocols get exploited: Bob's 690 senior tokens get paid before any junior tokens. He can withdraw up to 990 yield tokens.
7. if there was no exploit: Alice's 310 senior tokens get paid before any junior tokens. She can withdraw up to 1010 yield tokens.
```

## üèóÔ∏è Protocol Architecture

### Core Contracts

- **[`RiskVault.sol`](contracts/RiskVault.sol)**: Main protocol contract managing deposits, claims, and tokenization
- **[`RiskToken.sol`](contracts/RiskToken.sol)**: ERC20 implementation for risk tokens with mint/burn functionality
- **[`IRiskToken.sol`](contracts/IRiskToken.sol)**: Interface for risk token operations

### Supported Assets

- **aUSDC**: Aave interest-bearing USDC
- **cUSDT**: Compound interest-bearing USDT
- _Extensible to other yield-bearing assets_

### Risk Token Tiers

| Token Type | Risk Level | Claim Priority | Use Case                         |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| CM-SENIOR  | Lower      | First claims   | Conservative insurance providers |
| CM-JUNIOR  | Higher     | Subordinate    | Risk-seeking yield farmers       |

## üîÑ Protocol Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Active Period (5 days)

- Combined deposit and coverage period for maximum flexibility
- Users can deposit yield-bearing assets at any time during the protocol lifecycle
- Active insurance coverage for all deposited assets
- Dual-tier risk tokens are minted 1:1 with deposits
- Tokens can be traded immediately on Uniswap
- Withdrawals require equal amounts of senior and junior tokens
- Claims can be submitted and processed
- Risk tokens continue trading on secondary markets

### Phase 2: Claims Period (1 day)

- Priority redemption period for senior token holders
- Senior tokens have first claim on remaining assets
- Any combination of senior/junior tokens can be withdrawn (in normal mode)
- In emergency mode: only senior token withdrawals allowed
- Deposits continue to be accepted

### Phase 3: Final Claims (1 day)

- All remaining tokens can be redeemed with any combination of senior/junior
- Deposits continue to be accepted
- Protocol cycle completes and can restart

## üí∞ Economic Model

### For Insurance Providers

- **Deposit** yield-bearing assets to earn insurance premiums
- **Hold tokens** to bear risk and earn yield from claims that don't materialize
- **Sell tokens** to reduce risk exposure and lock in profits

### For Risk Traders

- **Buy risk tokens** on Uniswap to speculate on insurance outcomes
- **Sell risk tokens** to exit positions or reduce exposure
- **Arbitrage** between risk levels and market pricing

### For Insurance Seekers

- **Submit claims** backed by evidence when covered events occur
- **Receive payouts** from the insurance pool when claims are approved
- **Benefit** from community-funded insurance coverage

## ü¶Ñ Uniswap Integration

### Why Uniswap?

Risk tokens are standard ERC20 tokens that can be traded on any DEX. Uniswap provides:

- **Liquidity**: Deep markets for risk token trading
- **Price Discovery**: Market-driven risk pricing
- **Accessibility**: Anyone can buy/sell insurance risk
- **Composability**: Risk tokens can be used in other DeFi protocols

## üìä Key Metrics

### Protocol Health

- **Total Value Locked (TVL)**: Combined value of all deposited assets
- **Insurance Coverage Ratio**: Amount of active insurance coverage
- **Token Distribution**: Spread of risk across token holders
- **Claim Success Rate**: Percentage of approved vs submitted claims

### Market Dynamics

- **Risk Token Price**: Market valuation of insurance risk
- **Liquidity Depth**: Available trading volume on Uniswap
- **Volatility**: Price stability of risk tokens
- **Arbitrage Opportunities**: Price differences between risk tiers

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For Developers

#### Test Coverage

- Automated tests are provided for all core contracts in [`test/RiskToken.test.ts`](test/RiskToken.test.ts) and [`test/RiskVault.test.ts`](test/RiskVault.test.ts).
- The test suite covers:
  - Deployment and initialization
  - Minting and burning permissions and edge cases
  - Deposit and withdrawal logic, including error scenarios
  - Asset support and minimum/uneven deposit checks
  - Event emission and state changes
  - Revert and access control checks

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run all tests
npx hardhat test
```

All tests should pass. For troubleshooting, ensure you are using a compatible Node.js version and Hardhat is installed.

# Deploy to local network

npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/RiskToken.ts --network localhost
