Welcome to CoverMax Protocol - A revolutionary decentralized insurance protocol that transforms traditional insurance through **tradeable risk tokens** backed by **yield-bearing collateral**.

## What is CoverMax?

CoverMax is a decentralized insurance protocol that enables users to:

* **Deposit** yield-bearing assets (aUSDC, cUSDT) into insurance pools
* **Receive** tradeable risk tokens representing their insurance position
* **Trade** risk exposure on Uniswap based on market conditions
* **Earn** yields from insurance premiums and underlying assets
* **Claim** protection when covered events occur

## Core Innovation

The protocol's key innovation lies in its **dual-tier risk tokenization**:

* **CM-SENIOR Tokens**: Lower risk, priority claims during redemption
* **CM-JUNIOR Tokens**: Higher risk, subordinate claims with greater yield potential

These tokens can be freely traded on Uniswap, creating a liquid market for insurance risk.

## How It Works

1. **Deposit Phase** (2 days): Users deposit yield-bearing assets
2. **Token Issuance**: Receive equal amounts of Senior and Junior risk tokens
3. **Coverage Phase** (3 days): Active insurance period with tradeable tokens
4. **Claims Phase** (1 day): Senior token holders have priority redemption
5. **Final Claims** (1 day): All remaining tokens can be redeemed
