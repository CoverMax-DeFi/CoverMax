# Overview

## Introduction

CoverMax Protocol represents a paradigm shift in decentralized insurance, introducing a novel approach where insurance risk becomes a tradeable asset class. By combining yield-bearing collateral with dual-tier risk tokens, the protocol creates a dynamic marketplace for insurance coverage.

## The Problem

Traditional DeFi insurance protocols face several challenges:

* **Illiquid Positions**: Insurance providers lock capital for fixed periods
* **Binary Risk**: All-or-nothing exposure to insurance claims
* **Limited Price Discovery**: No real-time market valuation of risk
* **Capital Inefficiency**: Idle funds during quiet periods

## The CoverMax Solution

CoverMax addresses these challenges through:

### 1. **Tradeable Risk Tokens**
Insurance positions are tokenized into ERC20 tokens that can be traded on Uniswap, providing instant liquidity and continuous price discovery.

### 2. **Dual-Tier Risk Structure**
* **Senior Tokens (CM-SENIOR)**: Lower risk with priority claims
* **Junior Tokens (CM-JUNIOR)**: Higher risk with subordinate claims

This structure allows users to customize their risk exposure.

### 3. **Yield-Bearing Collateral**
The protocol accepts yield-bearing assets (aUSDC, cUSDT), ensuring capital generates returns even during coverage periods.

### 4. **Phase-Based Lifecycle**
A structured cycle ensures orderly deposits, coverage, and claims:
* Deposit Phase (2 days)
* Coverage Phase (3 days)
* Claims Phase (1 day)
* Final Claims (1 day)

## Protocol Mechanics

### Deposit and Tokenization

```
User deposits 1000 aUSDC
    ↓
Receives 500 CM-SENIOR + 500 CM-JUNIOR tokens
    ↓
Can trade tokens on Uniswap immediately
```

### Risk Transfer Through Trading

When you sell risk tokens on Uniswap, you're effectively:
* **Transferring insurance risk** to the buyer
* **Locking in profits** from your position
* **Providing coverage** to the protocol

### Claims and Redemption

During claims phases:
1. Senior token holders redeem first (priority)
2. Junior token holders redeem from remaining assets
3. Proportional distribution based on holdings

## Use Cases

### 1. **Protocol Treasury Management**
DeFi protocols can deposit treasury funds to earn yields while maintaining insurance coverage for their users.

### 2. **Risk Arbitrage**
Traders can arbitrage between Senior and Junior tokens based on market conditions and risk appetite.

### 3. **Dynamic Hedging**
Users can adjust their insurance exposure by trading tokens throughout the coverage period.

### 4. **Yield Optimization**
Investors can maximize returns by strategically trading between risk tiers based on market conditions.

## Protocol Advantages

| Feature | Traditional Insurance | CoverMax Protocol |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Liquidity | Locked until expiry | Instant via Uniswap |
| Risk Management | Fixed exposure | Dynamic through trading |
| Price Discovery | Opaque pricing | Real-time market prices |
